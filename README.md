# sql-challenge
In this challenge, we were given the task of analyzing 6 seperate CSV files using SQL in pgAdmin 4. This task was split up into three sections: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. In order to lay the groundwork for the data modeling, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using the website QuickDBD. In the ERD I engineered the data into tables, columns, data types and relationships (Primary and Foreign Keys). I used this tool to help develop my SQL table schema in pgAdmin. From there, I imported the data from the CSVs into the tables that I had just created. For the data analysis portion, I used several methods in order to analyze the data: queries, subqueries, joins, etc.
